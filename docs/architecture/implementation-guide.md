# Architecture Implementation Guide

This guide provides practical steps for implementing the Enhanced Feature-First Architecture in the Livestock Protect UI project.

## Overview

Based on the analysis of the current codebase and best practices for React applications, we've recommended the Enhanced Feature-First Architecture for the Livestock Protect UI project. This architecture organizes code primarily by features/domains, with each feature containing its own components, data access, and state management.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Directory Structure

Create the following directory structure at the root level:

```
src/
├── core/                  # Core utilities, configurations, and shared services
├── features/              # Feature modules
├── shared/                # Shared components, hooks, and utilities
├── app/                   # Application shell
└── main.tsx               # Entry point
```

### 2. Migrate Existing Code

1. **Move core functionality**:
   - Move configuration, themes, and utilities from the current `core` directory to the new structure
   - Move Firebase integration to `core/services/firebase`

2. **Create feature modules**:
   - Create a directory for each major feature (access-protect, contingency-planning, operations, etc.)
   - Follow the feature template structure for each feature

3. **Extract shared components**:
   - Identify components used across multiple features
   - Move them to the `shared/components` directory

4. **Refactor routing**:
   - Move routing-related code to `app/routing`
   - Update imports to reflect the new structure

### 3. Implement Feature Modules

For each feature, follow the structure provided in the feature template:

```
features/feature-name/
├── components/            # UI components specific to this feature
├── hooks/                 # Custom hooks for this feature
├── services/              # Services for this feature
├── state/                 # State management for this feature
├── types/                 # TypeScript types for this feature
├── utils/                 # Utilities specific to this feature
├── index.ts               # Public API for this feature
└── README.md              # Feature documentation
```

Key principles:
- Each feature should export its public API through its index.ts file
- Features should be self-contained with minimal dependencies on other features
- Shared functionality should be moved to the shared directory

### 4. Update Imports

Update import statements throughout the codebase to reflect the new structure:

```typescript
// Before
import { SomeComponent } from '../../components/some-component';

// After
import { SomeComponent } from '@/shared/components/some-component';
// or
import { SomeComponent } from '@/features/feature-name';
```

Consider using path aliases in tsconfig.json to simplify imports:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "@core/*": ["./src/core/*"],
      "@features/*": ["./src/features/*"],
      "@shared/*": ["./src/shared/*"],
      "@app/*": ["./src/app/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Document Architecture

1. Create architecture documentation:
   - Overall architecture diagram
   - Feature module structure
   - Coding standards and best practices

2. Document each feature:
   - Purpose and functionality
   - Component structure
   - API integration
   - State management

## Phased Implementation

To minimize disruption, implement the architecture in phases:

### Phase 1: Set Up Structure and Documentation

1. Create the new directory structure
2. Set up path aliases
3. Create architecture documentation
4. Create templates for new features

### Phase 2: Implement Core and Shared Modules

1. Migrate core functionality
2. Extract and refactor shared components
3. Update imports for core and shared modules

### Phase 3: Migrate Features One by One

1. Start with a small, self-contained feature
2. Refactor according to the new architecture
3. Update tests and documentation
4. Repeat for each feature

### Phase 4: Refactor App Shell and Routing

1. Create the app shell
2. Refactor routing to use the new structure
3. Update navigation components

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

1. **Feature Boundaries**:
   - Keep feature code within its directory
   - Minimize cross-feature dependencies
   - Use the feature's public API (index.ts) for external access

2. **Shared Code**:
   - Move code to shared directories only when used by multiple features
   - Keep shared components generic and reusable
   - Document shared code thoroughly

3. **State Management**:
   - Use React Query for server state
   - Use React Context for feature-specific state
   - Consider Zustand or similar for complex global state

### Documentation

1. **Architecture Documentation**:
   - Keep the architecture documentation up-to-date
   - Document architectural decisions using ADRs

2. **Feature Documentation**:
   - Document each feature using the README.md template
   - Include component documentation with JSDoc comments
   - Create Storybook stories for UI components

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test components, hooks, and utilities
   - Co-locate tests with the code they test

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test feature modules as a whole
   - Focus on user flows and interactions

## Tools and Resources

1. **Code Generation**:
   - Use the feature template as a starting point for new features
   - Consider creating scripts to generate new feature scaffolding

2. **Documentation**:
   - Use Storybook for component documentation
   - Use Mermaid or similar for architecture diagrams

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

## Conclusion

Implementing the Enhanced Feature-First Architecture will improve the maintainability, scalability, and developer experience of the Livestock Protect UI project. By following this guide and implementing the architecture in phases, the transition can be smooth and manageable.

Remember that architecture is not a one-time decision but an ongoing process. Regularly review and refine the architecture as the project evolves and requirements change.
