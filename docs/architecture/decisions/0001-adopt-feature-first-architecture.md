# Adopt Enhanced Feature-First Architecture

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The Livestock Protect UI application needs a clear architectural approach to ensure maintainability, scalability, and developer productivity. As the application grows in complexity and the team potentially expands, having a well-defined architecture becomes increasingly important.

The application is built with React 19, TypeScript, and uses various modern libraries including Material UI, React Query, and Firebase. It needs to support multiple features including access protection, contingency planning, operations management, and reporting.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for clear organization of code as the application grows
* Desire to enable parallel development by multiple team members
* Requirement for maintainable and testable code
* Goal to reduce cognitive load for developers working on specific features
* Need to balance separation of concerns with practical organization

## Considered Options

* **Enhanced Feature-First Architecture**: Organize code primarily by features/domains
* **Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design**: Strict separation of concerns with domain-driven design principles
* **Atomic Design with Component-Driven Development**: Organize UI components following atomic design principles

## Decision

Chosen option: "Enhanced Feature-First Architecture", because:

1. It aligns with the current organization of the codebase, requiring less refactoring
2. It provides clear boundaries between features, making it easier to understand and maintain
3. It facilitates parallel development by different teams or team members
4. It maintains a good balance between separation of concerns and practical organization
5. It's easier to understand for new developers joining the project

## Consequences

### Positive

* Clear ownership of features
* Easier to understand the codebase for new developers
* Better encapsulation of feature-specific code
* Easier to implement and maintain feature-specific business logic
* Facilitates parallel development by different teams

### Negative

* May lead to some code duplication across features
* Requires clear guidelines for shared code
* Can be challenging to refactor shared functionality

### Neutral

* Will require some refactoring of the current codebase to fully align with this architecture
* Need to establish clear guidelines for when code should be shared vs. feature-specific

## Implementation

The implementation will follow the structure outlined in the architecture documentation:

```
src/
├── core/                  # Core utilities, configurations, and shared services
├── features/              # Feature modules
│   ├── access-protect/    # Access protection feature
│   │   ├── components/    # UI components specific to this feature
│   │   ├── hooks/         # Custom hooks for this feature
│   │   ├── services/      # Services for this feature
│   │   ├── types/         # TypeScript types for this feature
│   │   ├── utils/         # Utilities specific to this feature
│   │   └── index.ts       # Public API for this feature
│   ├── contingency-planning/
│   ├── operations/
│   └── ...
├── shared/                # Shared components, hooks, and utilities
├── app/                   # Application shell
└── main.tsx               # Entry point
```

Implementation steps:

1. Create the directory structure
2. Move existing code to the appropriate locations
3. Refactor as needed to align with the new structure
4. Document the architecture and guidelines for developers

## Notes

While this architecture is the recommended approach for now, as the application grows and requirements evolve, we may need to incorporate more elements of Clean Architecture, particularly for complex business logic. This should be revisited periodically as the application matures.
