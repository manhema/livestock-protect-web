# Livestock Protect UI Architecture Documentation

This directory contains the architecture documentation for the Livestock Protect UI project. It provides guidance on the application architecture, code organization, documentation requirements, and development workflow.

## Documentation Overview

### [Architecture Options](./architecture-options.md)

This document outlines different architecture options for the Livestock Protect UI application:

1. **Enhanced Feature-First Architecture** (Recommended)
2. **Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design**
3. **Atomic Design with Component-Driven Development**

Each option includes a description, structure, pros, and cons. The document also provides a recommended architecture with implementation strategy and next steps.

### [Code Organization and Documentation](./code-organization-and-documentation.md)

This document provides guidelines for:

- **Code Organization**: Directory structure, feature module structure, and shared code guidelines
- **Documentation Requirements**: Project-level, feature-level, component, and API documentation
- **Documentation Tools**: Recommended tools for creating and maintaining documentation
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Practices to ensure documentation stays up-to-date

### [Development Workflow](./development-workflow.md)

This document outlines the recommended development workflow:

- **Branching Strategy**: Git Flow-inspired approach with main and supporting branches
- **Code Review Process**: PR guidelines and review procedures
- **Testing Approach**: Testing levels, guidelines, and best practices
- **Deployment Workflow**: Environments, deployment process, and verification
- **Development Best Practices**: Code quality and collaboration guidelines
- **Tools and Integrations**: Recommended development tools and integrations

### [Server-Client State Separation](./server-client-state-separation.md)

This document provides guidance on separating server state from client state:

- **What is Server State vs. Client State**: Definitions and distinctions
- **Architecture for State Separation**: Recommended folder structure
- **Implementation Guidelines**: How to implement server and client state management
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for effective state management
- **Example Implementations**: Concrete examples of server and client state management

## Architecture Decision Records

As the project evolves, important architectural decisions should be documented as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). These should be stored in the `docs/architecture/decisions` directory.

## Getting Started

To implement the recommended architecture:

1. Review the [Architecture Options](./architecture-options.md) document and confirm the selected architecture
2. Follow the [Code Organization and Documentation](./code-organization-and-documentation.md) guidelines for new code
3. Adopt the [Development Workflow](./development-workflow.md) for the development process
4. Gradually refactor existing code to align with the recommended architecture

## Next Steps

1. Create templates for feature documentation
2. Set up Storybook for component documentation
3. Create an initial architecture diagram
4. Establish a CI/CD pipeline following the development workflow
5. Create PR and issue templates

## Contributing to This Documentation

This documentation should evolve with the project. When making significant changes to the architecture or development workflow:

1. Update the relevant documentation
2. Create an ADR if necessary
3. Communicate changes to the team
4. Ensure the documentation remains consistent across all documents
