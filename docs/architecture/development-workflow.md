# Development Workflow

This document outlines the recommended development workflow for the Livestock Protect UI project, including branching strategy, code review process, testing approach, and deployment workflow.

## Branching Strategy

We recommend using a Git Flow-inspired branching strategy with the following branches:

### Main Branches

- **main**: Production-ready code that has been deployed to production
- **develop**: Integration branch for features that are ready for testing

### Supporting Branches

- **feature/[feature-name]**: For developing new features
- **bugfix/[issue-number]**: For fixing bugs
- **hotfix/[issue-number]**: For critical production fixes
- **release/[version]**: For preparing releases

### Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`:
   ```
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. Develop the feature with regular commits:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
   ```

3. Push the feature branch to remote:
   ```
   git push -u origin feature/my-feature
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request to merge into `develop`

5. After code review and approval, merge the feature branch into `develop`

6. For releases, create a release branch from `develop`:
   ```
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b release/1.0.0
   ```

7. After testing, merge the release branch into both `main` and `develop`

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Title**: Clear and concise description of the changes
2. **Description**: Include:
   - What changes were made
   - Why the changes were made
   - How to test the changes
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)
   - Link to related issues

3. **Size**: Keep PRs small and focused on a single task

4. **Checklist**:
   - [ ] Code follows style guidelines
   - [ ] Tests have been added/updated
   - [ ] Documentation has been updated
   - [ ] Changes have been tested locally

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**:
   - Linting
   - Type checking
   - Unit tests
   - Build verification

2. **Manual Review**:
   - Code quality and readability
   - Adherence to architecture and patterns
   - Performance considerations
   - Security implications

3. **Approval Requirements**:
   - At least one approval from a team member
   - All automated checks must pass
   - All review comments must be addressed

4. **Merge Strategy**:
   - Squash and merge for feature branches
   - Merge commit for release branches

## Testing Approach

### Testing Levels

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual components, hooks, and utilities
   - Focus on business logic and edge cases
   - Use Vitest and React Testing Library

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Test data flow through the application
   - Mock external dependencies

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Test complete user flows
   - Use Cypress or Playwright
   - Focus on critical paths

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Test Coverage**:
   - Aim for at least 80% code coverage
   - 100% coverage for critical business logic
   - Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details

2. **Test Organization**:
   - Co-locate tests with the code they test
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

3. **Mocking**:
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Use MSW for API mocking
   - Create reusable mock factories

4. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Run tests on every PR
   - Run full test suite before deployment
   - Monitor test performance and flakiness

## Deployment Workflow

### Environments

1. **Development**:
   - Automatic deployment from the `develop` branch
   - Used for integration testing
   - May be unstable

2. **Staging**:
   - Deployment from release branches
   - Mirror of production environment
   - Used for final testing before production

3. **Production**:
   - Deployment from the `main` branch
   - Requires manual approval
   - Includes post-deployment verification

### Deployment Process

1. **Build**:
   - Create optimized production build
   - Run final linting and type checking
   - Generate build artifacts

2. **Test**:
   - Run full test suite
   - Perform smoke tests
   - Check for performance regressions

3. **Deploy**:
   - Upload build artifacts to hosting service
   - Update configuration if needed
   - Run database migrations if applicable

4. **Verify**:
   - Perform post-deployment checks
   - Monitor for errors
   - Check key metrics

5. **Rollback Plan**:
   - Keep previous version available
   - Document rollback procedure
   - Test rollback process regularly

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality

1. **Linting and Formatting**:
   - Use ESLint for code quality
   - Use Prettier for code formatting
   - Run linting as part of CI/CD

2. **Type Safety**:
   - Use TypeScript for all code
   - Avoid using `any` type
   - Define interfaces for all data structures

3. **Performance**:
   - Use React.memo for expensive components
   - Optimize re-renders with useMemo and useCallback
   - Use code splitting for large features

### Collaboration

1. **Communication**:
   - Document decisions in PR descriptions
   - Use issue tracking for feature requests and bugs
   - Keep documentation up-to-date

2. **Knowledge Sharing**:
   - Conduct regular code reviews
   - Pair programming for complex features
   - Document architectural decisions

3. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Regular retrospectives
   - Update workflow based on team feedback
   - Refactor technical debt regularly

## Tools and Integrations

1. **Development Tools**:
   - VS Code with recommended extensions
   - ESLint and Prettier integrations
   - Git hooks for pre-commit checks

2. **CI/CD**:
   - GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD platform
   - Automated testing and deployment
   - Status checks for PRs

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
   - Performance monitoring
   - Usage analytics

## Next Steps

1. Set up CI/CD pipeline
2. Configure linting and formatting tools
3. Create PR and issue templates
4. Document environment setup
5. Establish regular code review schedule
